"""
SINGULARITY — Fresh Agent Install
=====================================

Creates a clean .core/ directory for a new agent persona.
Archives any existing .core/ to prevent state bleed.

This is the LAST step of installation, AFTER:
1. Codebase is deployed
2. Dependencies are installed  
3. C-Suite is deployed (Discord channels, etc.)
4. Config is set (singularity.yaml)

THEN this script runs to create and name the agent that will
inhabit the Singularity runtime. Fresh slate. No corruption.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/fresh_install.py                    # Interactive
    python3 scripts/fresh_install.py --manifest agent.yaml  # From manifest
    python3 scripts/fresh_install.py --name "Singularity" --emoji "⚡" --role "Autonomous Enterprise Runtime"

The manifest file (agent.yaml) is the single source of truth
for WHO the agent is. Everything else is generated from it.
