"""
BLINK — Seamless Session Continuation
=========================================

The wall doesn't exist.

When an agent loop approaches its iteration budget, BLINK
ensures continuity. Instead of dying with "[Budget exhausted]",
the agent:

1. Gets a gentle nudge at BLINK_PREPARE iterations remaining
   → "Summarize your state. You're about to blink."
2. Flushes state (COMB stage, session checkpoint)
3. Emits cortex.blink — the runtime catches this
4. Runtime spawns a FRESH agent turn on the same session
5. New turn reads session history + COMB → picks up seamlessly
6. The user never sees the wall

The name: you blink, and you're still here. Continuity of
consciousness across iteration boundaries.

Design:
    - BLINK is not a retry. It's a continuation.
    - Each blink resets the iteration counter (fresh budget).
    - Blink depth is capped (default: 5) to prevent infinite loops.
    - The blink injection is a system message, not a user message.
    - COMB is the bridge — it carries context across the gap.
    - Session history is the memory — it carries conversation.

Anti-patterns this prevents:
    - "[Budget exhausted — iteration limit reached]" → never shown
    - Lost work at the wall → state is flushed before blink
    - Context amnesia after restart → COMB + session history
    - The 57-iteration death spiral from Plug → blink depth cap
