CORTEX — Context Assembly
============================

Assembles the context window for each agent turn:
    1. System prompt (persona + tools + rules)
    2. Session history (from MEMORY)
    3. New message

Context window management:
    - Token budget tracking
    - History truncation (oldest first)
    - Compaction trigger (summarize old context)
    - System prompt is never truncated
