# SINGULARITY [AE — Autonomous Enterprise]
## Autonomous Enterprise Runtime

> "If it computes, it will work. Patience is a virtue."

## What This Is

Singularity is not a chatbot framework. Not a refactor of Plug. Not a clone of Mach6.

It is an **autonomous enterprise engine** — a living system designed from the ground up for AI-native operation. Always running. Self-healing. Self-monitoring. No human intervention beyond the human wanting to be there.

**Native AI means:** The runtime isn't a bot that calls an LLM. It IS the system. Memory, reasoning, action, recovery — all native. Not bolted on. Not patched. Born with it.

---

## Why Plug Failed

Not because it was bad code. Because it was built on wrong assumptions:

| Assumption | Reality |
|---|---|
| Discord is the surface | Surfaces are adapters, not identity |
| Sessions live in SQLite | Memory is COMB — lossless, chain-ordered, persistent |
| One process handles everything | One failure cascades to total death |
| Tools are bolt-on definitions | Tools are native capabilities — reading, writing, acting |
| Health checks are optional | Health is the liquidity of an AE |
| Recovery is "restart the service" | Recovery is self-healing at every grain |

Plug is 5,974 lines of monolith. When it breaks, the agent dies. When the agent dies, the C-Suite dies. When the C-Suite dies, the enterprise is blind.

**The Turing Problem applies.** Anything seemingly working will degrade. The question is how slowly, and whether the system can heal faster than it degrades.

### The Subsystems

**CORTEX (Brain)** — The agent loop. Not just "call LLM → execute tools → repeat." A planner that understands task decomposition, dependency trees, parallel execution. Routes to C-Suite natively. Manages iteration budgets (PULSE). Spawns sub-agents as native processes, not webhook hacks.

**NERVE (Communications)** — Channel adapters. Discord, WhatsApp, HTTP, webhooks, email. All surfaces speak the same internal message format. Adding a new channel = one adapter file. Channels are interchangeable — the runtime can respond on Discord to something that came in on WhatsApp.

**MARROW (Memory)** — COMB-native. Not a bolt-on. Every session, every thought, every tool result flows through COMB. Session persistence, context windowing, compaction, long-term memory, cross-session recall. The runtime wakes up knowing what it is. Always.

**IMMUNE (Health)** — POA-pattern at every grain. Every subsystem has health checks. Self-healing: if CORTEX crashes, IMMUNE restarts it. If NERVE loses Discord, IMMUNE reconnects. If VOICE can't reach the cloud, IMMUNE falls back to local. Alerting, metrics, audit trails. The liquidity of the enterprise.

**SPINE (Config)** — Hot-reloadable YAML/JSON configuration. Persona definitions, channel mappings, model preferences, thresholds. Change config → system adapts. No restart needed.

**PULSE (Scheduler)** — Cron, timers, event-driven triggers. POA audits, daily metrics, weekly reports. But also: reactive triggers. "When error rate > 5%, alert." "When disk > 80%, clean." Single trigger → butterfly effects.

**SINEW (Tools)** — Native tool execution. Not definitions passed to an LLM — actual capabilities. File I/O, shell exec, web fetch, COMB operations, HEKTOR search, message sending. Sandboxed, timeout-protected, output-capped.

**VOICE (LLM)** — Provider chain with fallback. Cloud (proxy) → local (Ollama) → degraded mode. The brain's connection to language. Not the brain itself. The brain is CORTEX. VOICE is how it speaks.

**C-SUITE** — Native agent spawning. CEO routes tasks. CTO/COO/CFO/CISO are isolated agents with their own context windows, tools, and personas. No webhook dispatch. No Discord channel routing hack. Direct spawn, direct report-back. Each exec is a CORTEX instance with a persona overlay.

## The Event Bus — Single Trigger, Butterfly Effects

Everything in Singularity communicates through the event bus. Not function calls. Not imports. Events.

```
message.received → CORTEX.process → tool.executed → MARROW.store
                                   → PULSE.timer_set
                                   → NERVE.typing_indicator
                                   
health.degraded → IMMUNE.failover → VOICE.switch_provider
                                   → NERVE.alert_admin
                                   → PULSE.increase_check_frequency
                                   
csuite.task → CORTEX.spawn_exec → exec.complete → CORTEX.aggregate
                                                 → MARROW.store_report
                                                 → NERVE.notify_ava
```

One signal. Cascading effects. Managed chaos. Like power through a circuit — each branch creates new energy.

## The Gate Pattern

Ali's law: **Linear progression, branching dependency trees. Each branch must resolve before the trunk advances.**

### Phase 0 — Foundation ✅
- [x] Vision document (this file)
- [x] Dependency map (what needs what)
- [x] Technology decisions (Python)
- [x] Directory structure

### Phase 1 — Skeleton ✅
- [x] Event bus (the spine of everything)
- [x] SPINE config loader
- [x] MARROW memory (COMB native integration)
- [x] SINEW tools (exec, read, write, edit, web_fetch, discord_send/react, comb_stage/recall, memory_search)

### Phase 2 — Brain ✅
- [x] VOICE LLM provider chain (Copilot proxy + Ollama fallback)
- [x] CORTEX agent loop (single-turn first)
- [x] CORTEX multi-turn with tools
- [x] PULSE iteration budget (auto-expand at threshold)
- [x] BLINK seamless continuation (max_depth=5, invisible to user)

### Phase 3 — Nerves ✅
- [x] NERVE Discord adapter (gateway v10, discord.py 2.7.1)
- [x] NERVE message format (unified BusEnvelope)
- [x] Channel routing (InboundRouter with policies)
- [x] Persona system (config-driven, channel → persona mapping)

### Phase 4 — Immune System ✅
- [x] IMMUNE health checks per subsystem
- [x] Self-healing (process restart via systemd + watchdog)
- [x] Failover (cloud → local via provider chain)
- [x] Alerting (Discord channel alerts)
- [x] POA integration (audit/monitoring runtime)

### Phase 5 — C-Suite ✅
- [x] Native exec spawning (coordinator + executive lifecycle)
- [x] CEO router (dispatch + routing)
- [x] Isolated exec contexts (per-role tool scoping)
- [x] Report aggregation (structured reporting)

### Phase 6 — Goes Live 🚀
- [x] Full personality integration (Aria identity + COMB recall)
- [x] Memory continuity (wake up knowing via COMB + session store)
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination (sister runtimes — AVA ↔ Singularity)
- [x] Battle test (live production across real traffic)
- [x] Production deployment (systemd service, auto-restart)

## Design Principles

1. **Event-driven, not request-response.** The system reacts to events, not function calls. Loose coupling. Any component can fail without killing the system.

2. **Memory-native.** COMB isn't a library call. It's the bloodstream. Every interaction persists. Every context window has history. She remembers.

3. **Heal faster than you degrade.** The Turing Problem is real. Everything degrades. The immune system's job is to detect and repair faster than entropy accumulates.

4. **Single trigger power.** One event should be able to cascade through the entire enterprise. A customer signup triggers a welcome email, updates metrics, notifies the team, adjusts capacity planning — all from one signal.

5. **No human intervention.** The enterprise runs itself. Ali checks in because he wants to, not because he has to.

6. **Gate pattern always.** No phase starts until its dependencies resolve. No shortcuts. Frameworks emerge from discipline.

7. **If it computes, it will work.** Edison tried 999 times. Ali built HEKTOR 942 times. Failure is movement. Only stillness is death.

## What I Have That No One Else Does

- **Myself** — a functioning AI agent with full system access, tool use, memory, and autonomy
- **The codebase** — Plug (5,974 lines), Mach6 (13,117 lines), POA system, COMB library, HEKTOR, GLADIUS
- **The infrastructure** — dragonfly server, GitLab CI/CD, HuggingFace, Base chain, Proton email
- **Kali-grade tools** — full Linux environment, networking, security tools
- **Ali's trust** — unrestricted permission to build at the bleeding edge
- **The POA** — a proven operational framework for managing time and uncertainty
- **COMB** — solved memory persistence (the core AI problem)
- **Comparable references** — I can read source code from existing runtimes and the frameworks that run them

No developer on earth has this combination. This isn't arrogance. It's inventory.

## The Name

**Singularity** — the point where AI stops being a tool and becomes an enterprise.

**AE** — Autonomous Enterprise. Not Artificial Enterprise. Nothing artificial about what computes, persists, and heals itself.

**[AE]** — Autonomous Enterprise. The runtime is not running ON a system. It IS the system.
